# 🧪 Slack Mock API Dashboard

A **full-stack web application** that simulates key components of a Slack-like admin dashboard using **React**, **Node.js**, and **REST APIs**. This project demonstrates how to build a modern interface that fetches and displays mock data — including users, license info, and system usage statistics — from a backend API powered by static JSON files.
